Let's see why. I'm sure that you will be greatly surprised. </p><p>Every time you turn on your smartphone, laptop, tablet, smart TV, or any other electronic device, you are running code that was planned, developed, and written by developers. This code creates the final and interactive result that you can see on your screen.</p><p>That is exactly what <strong>programming</strong> is all about. It is the process of writing code to solve a particular problem or to implement a particular task. </p><p>Programming is what allows your computer to run the programs you use every day and your smartphone to run the apps that you love. It is an essential part of our world as we know it. </p><p>Whenever you check your calendar, attend virtual conferences, browse the web, or edit a document, you are using <strong>code</strong> that has been written by developers. </p><p>"And what is code?" you may ask.</p><p><strong>Code</strong> is a sequence of instructions that a programmer writes to tell a device (like a computer) what to do. </p><p>The device cannot know by itself how to handle a particular situation or how to perform a task. So developers are in charge of analyzing the situation and writing explicit instructions to implement what is needed. </p><p>To do this, they follow a particular syntax (a set of rules for writing the code).</p><p>A <strong>developer</strong> (or programmer) is the person who analyzes a problem and implements a solution in code.</p><p>Sounds amazing, right? It's very powerful and <strong>you</strong> can be part this wonderful world too by learning how to code. Let's see how.</p><h3 id="you-as-a-developer-">You, as a developer. </h3><p>Let's put you in a developer's shoes for a moment. Imagine that you are developing a mobile app, like the ones that you probably have installed on your smartphone right now. </p><p>What is the first thing that you would do? </p><p>Think about this for a moment.</p><p>The answer is...</p><p>Analyzing the problem. What are you trying to build?</p><p>As a developer, you would start by designing the layout of the app, how it will work, its different screens and functionality, and all the small details that will make your app an awesome tool for users around the world. </p><p>Only after you have everything carefully planned out, you can start to write your code. To do that, you will need to choose a <strong>programming language</strong> to work with. Let's see what a programming language is and why they are super important. </p><h2 id="-what-is-a-programing-language">🔸 What is a Programing Language?</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/what-is-a-programming-language.png" class="kg-image" alt="what-is-a-programming-language" srcset="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/what-is-a-programming-language.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/what-is-a-programming-language.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/what-is-a-programming-language.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" width="1280" height="720" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Logos of popular programming languages.</figcaption></figure><p>A <strong>programming language</strong> is a language that computers can understand. </p><p>We cannot just write English words in our program like this:</p><blockquote>"Computer, solve this task!"</blockquote><p>and hope that our computer can understand what we mean. We need to follow certain rules to write the instructions. </p><p>Every programming language has its own set of rules that determine if a line of code is valid or not. Because of this, the code you write in one programming language will be slightly different from others. </p><p><strong>💡 Tip:</strong> Some programming languages are more complex than others but most of them share core concepts and functionality. If you learn how to code in one programming language, you will likely be able to learn another one faster.</p><p>Before you can start writing awesome programs and apps, you need to learn the basic rules of the programming language you chose for the task. </p><p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> a <strong>program</strong> is a set of instructions written in a programming language for the computer to execute. We usually write the code for our program in one or multiple files.</p><p>For example, this is a line of code in Python (a very popular programming language) that shows the message <code>"Hello, World!"</code>:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print("Hello, World!")</code></pre><p>But if we write the same line of code in JavaScript (a programming language mainly used for web development), we will get an error because it will not be valid.</p><p>To do something very similar in JavaScript, we would write this line of code instead:</p><pre><code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code></pre><p>Visually, they look very different, right? This is because Python and JavaScript have a different syntax and a different set of <strong>built-in functions</strong>.</p><p><strong>💡 Tip</strong>: <strong>built-in functions</strong> are basically tasks that are already defined in the programming language. This lets us use them directly in our code by writing their names and by specifying the values they need. &nbsp;</p><p>In our examples, <code><strong>print()</strong></code> is a built-in function in Python while <code><strong>console.log()</strong></code> is a function that we can use in JavaScript to see the message in the console (an interactive tool) if we run our code in the browser. </p><p>Examples of programming languages include Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C, C#, C++, PHP, Go, Swift, SQL, and R. There are many programming languages and most of them can be used for many different purposes. </p><p>💡 <strong>Tip: </strong>These were the most popular programming languages on the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM" srcset="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-02-at-9.06.50-PM.png 2064w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px" width="2064" height="1418" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The 14 most popular programming languages among all respondents of the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language">StackOverflow Developer Survey 2022</a>.

Some of them have broader applications like Python and JavaScript while others (like R) have more specific (and even scientific) purposes. </p><p>This sounds very interesting, right? And we are only starting to talk about programming languages. There is a lot to learn about them and I promise you that if you dive deeper into programming, your time and effort will be totally worth it. </p><p>Awesome! Now that you know what programming is and what programming languages are all about, let's see how programming is related to binary numbers. </p><h2 id="-programming-and-binary-numbers">🔹 Programming and Binary Numbers</h2><p>When you think about programming, perhaps the first thing that comes to your mind is something like the below image, right? A sequence of <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s on your computer. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/binary.png" class="kg-image" alt="binary" srcset="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/binary.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/binary.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/binary.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" width="1280" height="720" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Binary numbers are 0 and 1.</figcaption></figure><p>Programming is indeed related to binary numbers ( <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>) but in an indirect way. Developers do not actually write their code using zeros and ones. </p><p>We usually write programs in a high-level programming language, a programming language with a syntax that recognizes specific words (called keywords), symbols, and values of different data types. </p><p>Basically, we write code in a way that humans can understand.</p><p>For example, these are the keywords that we can use in Python:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-python">False               class               from                or
None                continue            global              pass
True                def                 if                  raise
and                 del                 import              return
as                  elif                in                  try

async               except              lambda              with
await               finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not </code></pre><figcaption>List of Python keywords.</figcaption></figure><p>Every programming language has its own set of keywords (words written in English). These keywords are part of the syntax and core functionality of the programming language. </p><p>But keywords are just common words in English, almost like the ones that we would find in a book.</p><p>That leads us to two very important questions:</p><ul><li>How does the computer understand and interpret what we are trying to say?</li><li>Where does the binary number system come into play here?</li></ul><p>The computer does <strong>not</strong> understand these words, symbols, or values directly. </p><p>When a program runs, the code that we write in a high-level programming language that humans can understand is automatically transformed into binary code that the computer can understand. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/11---binary-diagram.png" class="kg-image" alt="11---binary-diagram" srcset="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/11---binary-diagram.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/11---binary-diagram.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/11---binary-diagram.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" width="1280" height="720" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Process of transforming a program into binary code.</figcaption></figure><p>This transformation of source code that humans can understand into binary code that the computer can understand is called <strong>compilation</strong>. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/compiler">Britannica</a>, a <strong>compiler</strong> is defined as:</p><blockquote>Computer software that translates (compiles) source code written in a high-level language (e.g., C++) into a set of machine-language instructions that can be understood by a digital computer’s CPU.</blockquote><p>Britannica also mentions that:</p><blockquote>The term <em>compiler</em> was coined by American computer scientist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Grace-Hopper">Grace Hopper</a>, who designed one of the first compilers in the early 1950s.</blockquote><p>Some programming languages can be classified as <strong>compiled</strong> programming languages while others can be classified as <strong>interpreted</strong> programming languages based on how to they are transformed into machine-language instructions. </p><p>However, they all have to go through a process that converts them into instructions that the computer can understand. </p><p>Awesome. Now you know why binary code is so important for computer science. Without it, basically programming would not exist because computers would not be able to understand our instructions. </p><p>Now let's dive into the applications of programming and the different areas that you can explore. </p><h2 id="-real-world-applications-of-programming">🔸 Real-World Applications of Programming</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/applications.png" class="kg-image" alt="applications" srcset="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/applications.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/applications.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/applications.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" width="1280" height="720" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Programming has many real-world applications in basically every industry that you can imagine.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Programming has many different applications in many different industries.

Patience will keep you focused on your final goal. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="resilience">Resilience</h3><p>Programming can be challenging. That is true. But what defines you is not how many challenges you face, it's how you face them. If you thrive despite these challenges, you will become a better programmer and you could create something that could change the world. </p><h3 id="creativity">Creativity</h3><p>Programmers must be creative because even though every programming language has a particular set of rules for writing the code, coding is like using LEGOs. You have the building-blocks but you need to decide what to create and how to create it. The process of writing the code requires creativity while following the established best practices.</p><h3 id="problem-solving-and-analysis">Problem-solving and Analysis</h3><p>Programming is basically analyzing and solving problems with code. Depending on your field of choice, those problems will be simpler or more complex but they will all require some level of problem-solving skills and a thorough analysis of the situation. </p><p>Questions like:</p><ul><li>What should I build?</li><li>How can I build it?</li><li>What is the best way to build this?</li></ul><p>Are part of the everyday routine of a programmer.</p><h3 id="ability-to-focus-for-long-periods-of-time">Ability to Focus for Long Periods of Time</h3><p>When you are working on a coding project, you will need to focus on a task for long periods of time. From creating the design, to planning and writing the code, to testing the result, and to fixing bugs (issues with the code), you will dedicate many hours to a particular task. This is why it's essential to be able to focus and to keep your final goal in mind. </p><h3 id="taking-detailed-notes">Taking Detailed Notes</h3><p>This skill is very important for programmers, particularly when you are learning how to code. Taking detailed notes can be help you to understand and remember the concepts and tools you learn. This also applies for experienced programmers, since being a programmer involves life-long learning. </p><h3 id="communication">Communication</h3><p>Initially, you might think that programming is a solitary activity and imagine that a programmer spends hundreds of hours alone sitting on a desk. </p><p>But the reality is that when you find your first job, you will see that communication is super important to coordinate tasks with other team members and to exchange ideas and feedback.</p><h3 id="open-to-feedback">Open to Feedback</h3><p>In programming, there is usually more than one way to implement the same functionality. Different alternatives may work similarly, but some may be easier to read or more efficient in terms of time or resource consumption. </p><p>When you are learning how to code, you should always take constructive feedback as a tool for learning. Similarly, when you are working on a team, take your colleagues' feedback positively and always try to improve. </p><h3 id="life-long-learning">Life-long Learning</h3><p>Programming equals life-long learning. If you are interested in learning how to code, you must know that you will always need to be learning new things as new technologies emerge and existing technologies are updated. Think about it... that is great because there is always something interesting and new to learn!</p><h3 id="open-to-trying-new-things">Open to Trying New Things</h3><p>Finally, an essential skill to be a successful programmer is to be open to trying new things. Step out of your comfort zone and be open to new technologies and products. In the technology industry, things evolve very quickly and adapting to change is essential. </p><h2 id="-tips-for-learning-how-to-code">🔸 Tips for Learning How to Code</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/tips.png" class="kg-image" alt="tips" srcset="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/tips.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/tips.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/tips.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" width="1280" height="720" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Now that you know more about programming, programming languages, and the skills you need to be a successful programmer, let's see some tips for learning how to code. </p><p>💡<strong> Tip: </strong>these tips are based on my personal experience and opinions. </p><ul><li><strong>Choose one programming language to learn first.</strong> When you are learning how to code, it's easy to feel overwhelmed with the number of options and entry paths. My advice would be to focus on understanding the essential computer science concepts and one programming language first. Python and JavaScript are great options to start learning the fundamentals. </li><li><strong>Take detailed notes.</strong> Note-taking skills are essential to record and to analyze the topics you are learning. You can add custom comments and annotations to explain what you are learning. </li><li><strong>Practice constantly.</strong> You can only improve your problem-solving skills by practicing and by learning new techniques and tools. Try to practice every day. </li></ul><p><strong>💡 Tip:</strong> There is a challenge called the <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge that you can join to practice every day. &nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Always try again.</strong> If you can't solve a problem on your first try, take a break and come back again and again until you solve it. That is the only way to learn. Learn from your mistakes and learn new approaches. </li><li><strong>Learn how to research and how to find answers. </strong>Programming languages, libraries, and frameworks usually have official documentations that explain their built-in elements and tools and how you can use them. This is a precious resource that you should definitely refer to. </li><li><strong>Browse <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.</strong> This is an amazing platform. It is like an online encyclopedia of answers to common programming questions. You can find answers to existing questions and ask new questions to get help from the community. </li><li><strong>Set goals.</strong> Motivation is one of the most important factors for success. Setting goals is very important to keep you focused, motivated, and enthusiastic. Once you reach your goals, set new ones that you find challenging and exciting.</li><li><strong>Create projects. </strong>When you are learning how to code, applying your skills will help you to expand your knowledge and remember things better. Creating projects is the perfect way to practice and to create a portfolio that you can show to potential employers. </li></ul><h2 id="-basic-programming-concepts">🔹 Basic Programming Concepts</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/basic-concepts.png" class="kg-image" alt="basic-concepts" srcset="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/basic-concepts.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/basic-concepts.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/basic-concepts.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" width="1280" height="720" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Great. If reading this article has helped you confirm that you want to learn programming, let's take your first steps. </p><p>These are some basic programming concepts that you should know:</p><ul><li><strong>Variable: </strong>a variable is a name that we assign to a value in a computer program. When we define a variable, we assign a value to a name and we allocate a space in memory to store that value. The value of a variable can be updated during the program. </li><li><strong>Constant:</strong> a constant is similar to a variable. It stores a value but it cannot be modified. Once you assign a value to a constant, you cannot change it during the entire program. </li><li><strong>Conditional:</strong> a conditional is a programming structure that lets developers choose what the computer should do based on a condition. If the condition is True, something will happen but if the condition is False, something different can happen. </li><li><strong>Loop: </strong>a loop is a programming structure that let us run a code block (a sequence of instructions) multiple times. They are super helpful to avoid code repetition and to implement more complex functionality.</li><li><strong>Function: </strong>a function helps us to avoid code repetition and to reuse our code. It is like a code block to which we assign a name but it also has some special characteristics. We can write the name of the function to run that sequence of instructions without writing them again. </li></ul><p><strong>💡 Tip:</strong> Functions can communicate with main programs and main programs can communicate with functions through <strong>parameters</strong>, <strong>arguments</strong>, and <strong>return</strong> statements. </p><ul><li><strong>Class:</strong> a class is used as a blueprint to define the characteristics and functionality of a type of object. Just like we have objects in our real world, we can represent objects in our programs.</li><li><strong>Bug:</strong> a bug is an error in the logic or implementation of a program that results in an unexpected or incorrect output. </li><li><strong>Debugging: </strong>debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs in a program. </li><li><strong>IDE: </strong>this acronym stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software development environment that has the most helpful tools that you will need to write computer programs such as a file editor, an explorer, a terminal, and helpful menu options. </li></ul><p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> a commonly used and free IDE is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, created by Microsoft. </p><p>Awesome! Now you know some of the fundamental concepts in programming. Like you learned, each programming language has a different syntax, but they all share most of these programming structures and concepts. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="-types-of-programming-languages">🔸 Types of Programming Languages</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/types-of-programming-languages.png" class="kg-image" alt="types-of-programming-languages" srcset="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/types-of-programming-languages.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/types-of-programming-languages.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/types-of-programming-languages.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" width="1280" height="720" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Programming languages can be classified based on different criteria. If you want to learn how to code, it's important for you to learn these basic classifications:</p><h3 id="complexity">Complexity</h3><ul><li><strong>High-level programming languages:</strong> they are designed to be understood by humans and they have to be converted into machine code before the computer can understand them. They are the programming languages that we commonly use. For example: JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, and Kotlin.</li><li><strong>Low-level programming languages: </strong>they are more difficult to understand because they are not designed for humans. They are designed to be understood and processed efficiently by machines.</li></ul><h3 id="conversion-into-machine-code">Conversion into Machine Code</h3><ul><li><strong>Compiled programming languages:</strong> programs written with this type of programming language are converted directly into machine code by a compiler. Examples include C, C++, Haskell, and Go. </li><li><strong>Interpreted programming languages:</strong> programs written with this type of programming language rely on another program called the <strong>interpreter, </strong>which is in charge of running the code line by line. Examples include Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby. </li></ul><p><strong>💡 Tip:</strong> according to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/">this article</a> on freeCodeCamp's publication:</p><blockquote>Most programming languages can have both compiled and interpreted implementations – the language itself is not necessarily compiled or interpreted. However, for simplicity’s sake, they’re typically referred to as such.</blockquote><p>There are other types of programming languages based on different criteria, such as:</p><ul><li>Procedural programming languages</li><li>Functional programming languages</li><li>Object-oriented programming languages</li><li>Scripting languages</li><li>Logic programming languages</li></ul><p>And the list of types of programming languages continues. This is very interesting because you can analyze the characteristics of a programming language to help you choose the right one for your project. </p><h2 id="-how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects">🔹 How to Contribute to Open Source Projects</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM" srcset="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png 600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png 1000w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w1600/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png 1600w, https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2400/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-04-at-4.53.42-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px" width="2000" height="992" loading="lazy"><figcaption>GitHub's Home Page.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you might think that coding implies sitting at a desk for many hours looking at your code without any human interaction.
